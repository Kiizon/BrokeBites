BrokeBites is an extensive of my flipp scraper project, feeding user flyer deals to an llm to generate recipes.
This project is built with the intention of helping those who was to save but also learn how to cook by 
following a recipe based on local deals on ingredients. Times are tough so this is my take on trying to help
the world with code.

It's a work in progress
